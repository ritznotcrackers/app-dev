## Favorite Movies

Here are some of my favorite movies so far!

### The Velveteen Rabbit

The movie talks about how being real means. The movie explains that to be real you need to be loved, and for the case of Mr. Rabbit, a boy
named William is his bestfriend who loves him. Overall, the movie is great for family and children-alike.
